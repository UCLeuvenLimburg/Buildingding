== Introduction
Buildingding is a Proof of Concept application made for Campus Proximus to help people navigate through the campus. The application is not yet available on the Play Store.

== Git and GitHub

We can install git by first navigating to this url https://git-scm.com/downloads, and downloading the correct installer. Next run the installer, follow the steps and Git will be installed.

After these steps are completed, open a GitBash terminal and type the following command. It will fetch the application from a remote repository and store it locally.

== Android Studio
Now that we have our application on our device, we still need a way to run it and an emulator for a mobile device. Luckily for us Android Studio can serve as both. Go to the website of Android Studio (https://developer.android.com/studio), download and install the program.
