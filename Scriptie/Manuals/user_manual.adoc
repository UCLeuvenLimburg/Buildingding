== Buildingding: purpose

The purpose of Buildinding is to help the user navigate Campus Proximus. Which is especially helpfull with the standing cirucaltion planning due to the pandemic concerning 'COVID-19'. This applicatoin was written as a graduation project for UCLL Applied Informatices in 2020 by order of Dr Vogels F.

Once the path has been calculated, the user can choose to see the path as a list of locations or as a 2D visualisation on a map.

The application does not use real-time tracking.
