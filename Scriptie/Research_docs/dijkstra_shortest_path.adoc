= Research: Find Shortest Path Problem

The basic goal is to determine the shortest path between a starting node, and the rest of the graph, which is a
theoretic problem known to graph.

== Dijkstra Shortest Path Algorithm

*Dijkstra* algorithm a.k.a. *SPF* algorithm (Shortest Path First) is an algorithm for finding the shortest path
between nodes in a graph. Which in our case represents the Campus Proximus indoor path network.
The core idea is to continuously wipe out the longer paths between the starting node and all possible destinations.

Given a positively weighted graph and a starting Node(C001), SPF determines the shortest path and distance from the source to all destinations in graph.

- To keep track of process, two distinct sets of nodes are needed:
. *Settled nodes*: are the ones with a known minimum distance from the source.
. *Unsettled nodes*: gathers nodes that we can reach from the source. BUT with no knowledge about the min distance from the starting node.

=== Steps to follow in order to determine SPF:

. Set distance to start node to 0.
. Set all other distances to '∞' value.
. Add StartNode to unsettled nodes set.
. While (unsettled nodes set !== empty):
* Choose an evaluation node from the unsettled nodes.
- evaluation node == node with the lowest distance from source.
* Calculate distances to direct neighbors by keeping the lowest distance at each evaluation.
* Add neighbors that are not settled to the unsettled nodes set.

==== Initialization

We need to initialize all nodes with an infinite number distance and an unknown predecessor,
except de start node. For Node 'C001' we assign the value 0.
All the nodes except 'C001' will be distinguished with a predecessor *'X'* and a distance *'∞'*.

To complete initialization process, add node 'C001' to the unsettled nodes set. So it gets picked first in the evaluation step.
.Initialization Notes.
[NOTE]
===============================
. The distance from node C001 to C001 is 0.
. Settled nodes set is still empty.
===============================

==== Evaluation

After initializing the graph, pick the node with the lowest distance value from the unsettled nodes set, then we
evaluate all neighboring nodes that are not in settled nodes set:

Add the edge weight to the evaluation node distance, then compare it to the destination's distance.

*Example:* For node 'C002': 0 + 10 < ∞ , so the new distance for 'C002' is 10 and new predecessor is 'C001'

- Node 'C001' is moved from unsettled set to settled set.
- Nodes 'C002' and 'C003' are added to the unsettled set. They can be reached, but they need to be evaluated.
- We have now two nodes in unsettled set, we take the one with the lowest distance 'C002', then we reiterate until we settle all nodes in the graph.

.Dijkstra Table Notes.
[NOTE]
===============================
- The notation C002-22, for example, means that node C002 is the immediate predecessor, with a total distance of 22 from node C001.
- We can calculate the shortest paths from node C001 are as follows:
* Node C002 : C001 –> C002 (total distance = 10)
* Node C003 : C001 –> C003 (total distance = 15)
* Node C004 : C001 –> C002 –> C004 (total distance = 22)
* Node C005 : C001 –> C002 –> C004 –> C006 (total distance = 24)
* Node C006 : C001 –> C002 –> C004 –> C005 (total distance = 23)
