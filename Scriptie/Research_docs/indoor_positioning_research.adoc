= Research: Indoor positioning system

The goal is to find a technology wich will enable us to locate a person inside a multistory building using a smartphone.

== Possible technologies

After a preliminary research we came across several methods used in an indoor positioning system (I.P.S.)footnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_positioning_system]

=== Wireless technologies

==== WiFi-based positioning system

Wi-Fi positioning system (WPS) is a geolocation system that uses the characteristics of nearby Wi-Fi hotspots and other wireless access points to discover where a device is located. Wi-Fi positioning takes advantage of the rapid growth in the early 21st century of wireless access points in urban areas.

There are several techniques we could employ to use this technologie.
* Signal strength based
* Fingerprinting based
* Angle of arrival based
* Time of flight based

Each of these methods has its own merits and drawbacks.


==== Bluetooth

Originally, Bluetooth was concerned about proximity, not about exact location. Bluetooth was not intended to offer a pinned location like GPS, however is known as a geo-fence or micro-fence solution which makes it an indoor proximity solution, not an indoor positioning solution.

However, micromapping and indoor mapping has been linked to Bluetooth.
Bluetooth speaker position and home networks could be used for broad reference. 

==== Other wireless technologies

* Radio frequentie identificatoin (RFID)
* Ultrawide band (UWB)
* Infrared (IR)
* Gen2IR
* Visible light communication (VLC) 
* Ultrasound

=== Other technologies

Non-radio technologies can be used for positioning without using the existing wireless infrastructure. This could provide increased accuracy at the expense of costly equipment and installations. 

==== Magnetic positioning

Magnetic positioning can offer pedestrians with smartphones an indoor accuracy of 1â€“2 meters with 90% confidence level, without using the additional wireless infrastructure for positioning. Magnetic positioning is based on the iron inside buildings that create local variations in the Earth's magnetic field. Un-optimized compass chips inside smartphones can sense and record these magnetic variations to map indoor locations.

==== Inertial measurements

Dead reckoning is the process of calculating ones's current position by using a previously determined position by using estimations of speed and course over elapsed time.

==== Positioning based on visual markers

We could use the inbuild camera of the mobile device to determine the location. We can place markers like QR-codes at specific locations which encode that locations coordinates.

== Our reasoning

=== Wireless technology

Because we were writing an application for a smartphone the use of the inbuilt wireless capabilities looked the most promising.
We only needed external fixed beacons which could be used as a reference point.

==== Bluetooth

If we were to use Bluetooth, it would mean we had no pre-existing infrastructure of beacons.

==== WiFi

If we were to use WiFi, we could use the already present access point as the fixed reference points.
Because WPS could use several techniques the coice of WiFi looked the most promising

=== Other technology

==== Magnetic positioning

The mapping of the unique fingerprint of the building was deemed to complex to be accomplished during the allocated time period.

==== Inertial measurements

Using a smartphones inertial sensors would cause too much white noise by the appliance's gyroscopes. For example, a small tilt error in the calculated orientation would cause an accelaration onto the horizontal axes which would then be integrated twice, causing a rapidly growing error in the calculated position.footnote:[https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk//techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-696.pdf]

==== Positioning based on visual markers

The problem with visual markings seemed largely that the camera should always have line of sight with a marker, while the wireless option does not have this restriction.

== Our Choice

Since there is an existing WiFi infrastructure, the existance of several well known techniques and the users convenience had more priority we chose to use WPS.
